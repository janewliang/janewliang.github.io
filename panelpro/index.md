Risk evaluation to determine individuals who are at greater risk of cancer as a result of heritable mutations is a valuable component of individualized clinical management. Using principles of Mendelian genetics, Bayesian probability theory, and mutation-specific knowledge, Mendelian models identify those at high risk for carrying a pathogenic mutation and assess future risk of cancer, based on family history. Existing Mendelian models have been widely adopted, but are generally limited to specific mutations and syndromes. However, the rise of multi-gene panel germline testing has led to the discovery of many new gene-cancer associations that are not presently accounted for in these models. PanelPRO is a generalizable Mendelian risk prediction model that incorporates an arbitrary number of genes and cancers while overcoming the computational challenges that arise because of the increased model complexity.
