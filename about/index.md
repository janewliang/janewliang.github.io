<h2><a href="{{ page.url }}" style="color:inherit">{{ page.title }}</a></h2>

I am a senior biostatistician at the Quantitative Sciences Unit ([QSU](https://med.stanford.edu/qsu.html)), which is housed within the Department of Medicine at Stanford University. The QSU is a team of statistical scientists who work with collaborators across the university to advance research in public health and healthcare. My interests also include statistical software, computational algorithms, and data science education. 

I earned my PhD in biostatistics from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health's [Department of Biostatistics](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/biostatistics). My dissertation focused on statistical methodology and software development for clinical risk assessment in panel gene testing. Prior to grad school, I worked as a scientific programmer at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Department of Preventive Medicine, [Division of Biostatistics](https://www.uthsc.edu/preventive-medicine/biostatistics.php). I was born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area, where I received my bachelor's degree in [statistics](http://statistics.berkeley.edu) from UC Berkeley. In my spare time, I like to read books, consume hot beverages, and play with other people's pets.
