# {{ page.title }}

I am a first-year doctoral student at Harvard University's [Department of Biostatistics](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/biostatistics). My interests include statistical genetics, machine learning, and computational problems in high-dimensional data. I currently work with X on Y. 

Before entering graduate school, I was a scientific programmer at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Department of Preventive Medicine, [Division of Biostatistics](https://www.uthsc.edu/prevmed/biostatistics/index.php). I worked with [Dr. &#346;aunak Sen](http://senresearch.org) on matrix linear models for structured high-throughput data. Before that, I was a programming analysis associate at [Kaiser Permanente](https://healthy.kaiserpermanente.org). I received my bachelor's degree in statistics from [UC Berkeley](http://statistics.berkeley.edu). 

In my spare time, I enjoy reading books, consuming hot beverages, and playing with other people's pets.
