I am a Research Scientist I/Biostatistician at Kaiser Permanente Northern California's [Division of Research](https://divisionofresearch.kaiserpermanente.org/research/biostatistics/), where I provide expertise in study design and statistical methods as part of multidisciplinary research teams. My interests also include statistical software, computational algorithms, and data science education. Formerly, I was a senior biostatistician at the [Quantitative Sciences Unit](https://med.stanford.edu/qsu.html), located in the Stanford University School of Medicine. 

I earned my PhD in biostatistics from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health's [Department of Biostatistics](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/biostatistics). My dissertation focused on statistical methodology and software development for clinical risk assessment in panel gene testing. Prior to grad school, I worked as a scientific programmer at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Department of Preventive Medicine, [Division of Biostatistics](https://www.uthsc.edu/preventive-medicine/biostatistics.php). I was born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area, where I received my bachelor's degree in [statistics](http://statistics.berkeley.edu) from UC Berkeley. In my spare time, I like to read books, consume hot beverages, and play with other people's pets.
