<h2><a href="{{ page.url }}" style="color:inherit">{{ page.title }}</a></h2>

I am a first-year doctoral student at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health's [Department of Biostatistics](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/biostatistics). My current research rotation is with Giovanni Parmigiani's [BayesMendel Lab](http://bcb.dfci.harvard.edu/bayesmendel/index.php), which is concerned with developing models to predict cancer risk based on family history. I am interested in statistical genetics, machine learning, and computational problems involving high-dimensional data. 

I was born, raised, and educated in the San Francisco Bay Area, where I received my bachelor's degree in [statistics](http://statistics.berkeley.edu) from UC Berkeley. After graduating, I worked as a programming analysis associate at [Kaiser Permanente](https://healthy.kaiserpermanente.org) before moving to Memphis to be a scientific programmer at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Department of Preventive Medicine, [Division of Biostatistics](https://www.uthsc.edu/prevmed/biostatistics/index.php). Under the supervision of [&#346;aunak Sen](http://senresearch.org), I worked on matrix linear models for structured high-throughput data. In my spare time, I read books, consume hot beverages, and am highly amused by indifferent animals.

Interested in Lepidoptera or other insects? My brothers run a pretty cool [website](http://www.lianginsects.com) for their projects.
