I am a fifth-year doctoral candidate at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health's [Department of Biostatistics](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/biostatistics) and am fortunate to be supported by the [cancer training grant](https://sites.sph.harvard.edu/cancer-training-grant/) (2020 -- present) and [genomics training grant](https://sites.sph.harvard.edu/genomics-training-grant/) (2017 -- 2020). As a member of the [BayesMendel Lab](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/bayesmendel) led by  [Giovanni Parmigiani](https://scholar.harvard.edu/parmigiani/home) and [Danielle Braun](https://scholar.harvard.edu/dbraun/home), I build tools for clinical risk assessment in panel testing like [PanelPRO](https://janewliang.github.io/panelpro/) and think about [ways to aggregate information](https://janewliang.github.io/aggregate) across genes and cancers. My interests also include machine learning, computational algorithms, and [data science education](https://janewliang.github.io/teaching/). 

I was born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area, where I also received my bachelor's degree in [statistics](http://statistics.berkeley.edu) from UC Berkeley. After graduating, I worked as a programming analysis associate at [Kaiser Permanente](https://healthy.kaiserpermanente.org) before moving to Memphis to be a scientific programmer at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Department of Preventive Medicine, [Division of Biostatistics](https://www.uthsc.edu/preventive-medicine/biostatistics.php). Under the supervision of [&#346;aunak Sen](http://senresearch.org), I worked on [matrix linear models](https://janewliang.github.io/mlm/) for structured high-throughput data. In my spare time, I like to read books, consume hot beverages, and play with other people's pets.

Interested in Lepidoptera or other insects? My brothers run a pretty cool [website](http://www.lianginsects.com) for their projects.
