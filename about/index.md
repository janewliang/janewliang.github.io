I am a third-year doctoral candidate at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health's [Department of Biostatistics](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/biostatistics) and am fortunate to be supported by the [genomics training grant](https://sites.sph.harvard.edu/genomics-training-grant/). As a member of Giovanni Parmigiani's [BayesMendel Lab](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/bayesmendel), I work on building multi-gene, multi-cancer risk prediction models. My interests also include machine learning and computational algorithms. 

I was born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area, where I also received my bachelor's degree in [statistics](http://statistics.berkeley.edu) from UC Berkeley. After graduating, I worked as a programming analysis associate at [Kaiser Permanente](https://healthy.kaiserpermanente.org) before moving to Memphis to be a scientific programmer at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Department of Preventive Medicine, [Division of Biostatistics](https://www.uthsc.edu/prevmed/biostatistics/index.php). Under the supervision of [&#346;aunak Sen](http://senresearch.org), I worked on [matrix linear models](https://janewliang.github.io/mlm/) for structured high-throughput data. In my spare time, I read books, consume hot beverages, and am highly amused by indifferent animals.

Interested in Lepidoptera or other insects? My brothers run a pretty cool [website](http://www.lianginsects.com) for their projects.
