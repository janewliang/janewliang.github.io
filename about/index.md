I am a scientific programmer at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Department of Preventive Medicine, [Division of Biostatistics](https://www.uthsc.edu/prevmed/biostatistics/index.php). Under the supervision of [Dr. &#346;aunak Sen](http://senresearch.org), I work on matrix linear models for structured high-throughput data. Previously, I was a programming analysis associate at [Kaiser Permanente](https://healthy.kaiserpermanente.org). 

I was born, rasied, and educated in the San Francisco Bay Area, where I received my bachelor's degree in statistics from [UC Berkeley](http://statistics.berkeley.edu). My interests include statistical genetics, machine learning, and computational problems involving high-dimensional data. In the fall, I will enter the doctoral program at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health's [Department of Biostatistics](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/biostatistics). In my spare time, I read books, consume hot beverages, and am easily amused by indifferent animals.
