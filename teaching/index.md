I served as a TA for BST 260 (Introduction to Data Science) in [Fall 2019](https://github.com/datasciencelabs/2019) and [Fall 2020](https://github.com/datasciencelabs/2020), taught both years by [Heather Mattie](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/heather-mattie/). I am passionate about making data analysis more accessible for those who may not have had formal training in statistics. My favorite part about teaching (besides working directly with students) is designing curriculum materials that incorporate both practical application and critical thinking. 

The course materials that I created for BST 260 are listed below. Each assignment is designed to mimic a realistic data analysis, with the questions building toward an overarching narrative. In addition to R coding exercises, many questions emphasize interpreting results or data science communication. Topics and data sets were chosen to be relevant to student interests and pressing public health challenges.
