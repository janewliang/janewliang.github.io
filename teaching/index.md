I served as a TA for BST 260 (Introduction to Data Science) in [Fall 2019](https://github.com/datasciencelabs/2019) and [Fall 2020](https://github.com/datasciencelabs/2020), taught both years by [Heather Mattie](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/heather-mattie/). 

Course materials that I designed for BST 260 are listed below. In addition, I wrote the 2020 take-home midterm exam, which asked the students to build an interactive reporting dashboard for worldwide COVID-19 cases.
