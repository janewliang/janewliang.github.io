I am a senior biostatistician at the Quantitative Sciences Unit (QSU), located in the Stanford University School of Medicine, where I work in a collaborative team of data scientists to advance clinical research. I hold a PhD in biostatistics (Harvard University) and a BA in statistics (UC Berkeley).
