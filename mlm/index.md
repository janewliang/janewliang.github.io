Matrix linear models are a flexible and computationally efficient framework for detecting associations in structured high-throughput data. Examples include measuring gene transcription on a genome-wide scale using microarrays; the screening of genetic mutant libraries; screening for chemicals in human tissues using mass spectrometry; and subjecting cancer cells to a range of treatment drugs in order to identify genetic features targeted by particular therapies. 

We have developed closed-form least squares estimates applied to <a href="#genetic">genetic screening data</a> as well as <a href="#sparse">sparse algorithms</a>. 

We implemented our methods using the high-level programming language [Julia](https://julialang.org/), which combines ease of prototyping with computational speed.

I applied the least squares approach to *E. coli* genetic screening data and demonstrated its superior speed and flexibility over an existing method.

<h3><a name="sparse">Sparse matrix linear models for structured high-throughput data</a></h3>

Standard methods for estimation of these penalized regression models fail if the problem is converted to the corresponding univariate regression problem. All three fast algorithms (coordinate descent, FISTA, and ADMM) used to obtain sparse solutions are implemented in an open-source Julia package. Our method's performance was evaluated on simulated data based on an environmental screening study and two <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> genetic datasets with multivariate responses.
