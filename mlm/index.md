Matrix linear models are a flexible and computationally efficient framework for detecting associations in structured high-throughput data. Examples include measuring gene transcription on a genome-wide scale using microarrays; the screening of genetic mutant libraries; screening for chemicals in human tissues using mass spectrometry; and subjecting cancer cells to a range of treatment drugs in order to identify genetic features targeted by particular therapies.
