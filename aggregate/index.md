Currently, I am working on two projects that involve aggregating information across genes and/or diseases: 
<ul style="margin-bottom:0; margin-top:-10px">
<li>A Mendelian risk prediction model used for pre-screening for a test of any cancer that avoids needing comprehensive family history and robust parameter estimates for rare genes and syndromes (with Giovanni Parmigiani and Danielle Braun).</li>
<li>A utility tool for evaluating the addition and removal of genes in a panel test, based on both quantitative measures and individualized utility costs (with Peter Kraft and Robert C. Green).</li>
</ul>
