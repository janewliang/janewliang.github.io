I was delighted to be back at UC Berkeley for [JuliaCon 2017](http://juliacon.org/2017/) and to give a talk on L<sub>1</sub>-penalized matrix linear models for high-throughput data. You can [read the abstract](https://juliacon2017.sched.com/event/At3e/l1-penalized-matrix-linear-models-for-high-throughput-data) or [watch the talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbWMmxMiZFQ).
